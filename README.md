# Project3-3503
This was a group effort by the team:
Sergio Arcila
Aaron Hamburger
Zachary Schirm

The program uses the pygame libary along with pygame_menu and networkx to solve randomly generated mazes using popular algorithms 
including depth first search, breadth first search, and dijkstra's alorithm.  To create the mazes a recursive backtracker algorithm is used.
